## A blog which contains reading notes of some of the books I've read plus much more.

### This blog has been created using Jekyll. https://jekyllrb.com/

### The theme used is Lanyon Poole. https://github.com/poole/lanyon

## FYI

### The notes in each blog post aren't complete "summaries" of the books. Infact the notes were what I found important or worth highlighting in the book and something I wanted to look at again. There might be many points that I might've missed as I only added those which I could relate to and which had an impact no me. Ciao.
