I can pretty much guarantee that every time you tearfully ask yourself the question, “WTF is my problem?!” the answer lies in some lame, limiting, and false subconscious belief that you’ve been dragging around without even realizing it.

If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.—Nokola Tesla; inventor, physicist, supergenius

the basic idea is: Focus on that which makes you feel good and ye shall find (attract) that which makes you feel good.

André Gide, so aptly put it, “One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.”
