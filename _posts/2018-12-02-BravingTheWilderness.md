I wept for the parents who were so ill equipped to deal with my pain and vulnerability. Parents who just didn‚Äôt have the skills to speak up and comfort me or, at the very least, run an interception on the story of not belonging with them or to them. These are the moments that, when left unspoken and unresolved, send us into our adult lives searching desperately for belonging and settling for fitting in.
