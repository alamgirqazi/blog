#### Reading Notes:

We can choose courage or we can choose comfort, but we can’t have both. Not at the same time.

Daring is not saying, “I’m willing to risk failure.” Daring is saying, “I know I will eventually fail and I’m still all in.”

We’re wired for story. In a culture of scarcity and perfectionism, there’s a surprisingly simple reason we want to own, integrate, and share our stories of struggle. We do this because we feel the most alive when we’re connecting with others and being brave with our stories—it’s in our biology.

We own our stories so we don’t spend our lives being defined by them or denying them.

 Creating is the tool. Creating is the act of paying attention to our experiences and connecting the dots so we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us.

The only decision we get to make is what role we’ll play in our own lives: Do we want to write the story or do we want to hand that power over to someone else? Choosing to write our own story means getting uncomfortable; it’s choosing courage over comfort.
One of the truisms of wholehearted living is You either walk into your story and own your truth, or you live outside of your story, hustling for your worthiness

you’d be surprised how many of us never recognize our emotions or feelings—we off-load instead. Rather than saying I failed and it feels so crappy, we move to I am a failure. We act out and shut down rather than reaching out.

When we deny our stories and disengage from tough emotions, they don’t go away; instead, they own us, they define us. Our job is not to deny the story, but to defy the ending—to rise strong, recognize our story, and rumble with the truth until we get to a place where we think, Yes. This is what happened. This is my truth. And I will choose how this story ends.

focused on finding our way out of pain.
Einstein said, “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.” Curiosity’s reason for existing is not simply to be a tool used in acquiring knowledge; it reminds us that we’re alive.

A study published in the October 22, 2014, issue of the journal Neuron suggests that the brain’s chemistry changes when we become curious, helping us better learn and retain information. But curiosity is uncomfortable because it involves uncertainty and vulnerability.

Depression and anxiety are two of the body’s first reactions to stockpiles of hurt.

You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.
—Maya Angelou

Mindfulness means maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. Mindfulness also involves acceptance, meaning that we pay attention to our thoughts and feelings without judging them—without believing, for instance, that there’s a “right” or “wrong” way to think or feel in a given moment. When we practice mindfulness, our thoughts tune in to what we’re sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future.
“Because we are compelled to make stories, we are often compelled to take incomplete stories and run with them.”
