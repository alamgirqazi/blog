#### Reading Notes:

When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.

Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.

On Self-Knowledge:
For self is a sea boundless and measureless

On Teaching:
If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your mind.

On Friendship:
And let your best be for your friend.
If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also. 

For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.

On Talking:
You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;
And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you can live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.

And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.
For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.
