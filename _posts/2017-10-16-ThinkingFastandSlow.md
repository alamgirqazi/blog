#### Reading Notes:

the psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic

"The situation has provided a cue; this cure has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition."

The intuitive system 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.

Why is it so difficult for us to think statistically? We easily think associatively, we think metaphorically, we think casually, but statistics require thinking about many things at once, which is something System 1 is not designed to do.

System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.

System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice and concentration.

Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention. The most dramatic demonstration was offered by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons in their book, The Invisible Gorilla.

Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is too much slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when stakes are high.

As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes.

"flow", "a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems."

self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. This phenomenon has been named ego depletion.

A bat and ball costs $1.10
The bat costs one dollar more than the ball.
How much does the ball cost?

The bat and ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible. 

If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow.

Simple, common gestures can also unconsciously influence our thoughts and feelings.

You can see why the common admonition to "act calm and kind regardless of how you feel" is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.

The study of priming has come some way from the initial demonstration that reminding people of old age makes them walk more slowly.

Reminders of money produce some troubling effects.

Money-primed people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended to be confused about an experimental task.

The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism.

If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger.

If you use color, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue.

Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1.

Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.
