#### Reading Notes:

Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
—MARK TWAIN

Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.
—OSCAR WILDE

People don’t want to be millionaires—they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.
—RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, Nobel Prize–winning physicist

Once you say you’re going to settle for second, that’s what happens to you in life.

What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do

a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.

It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre.

Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.

The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?”

You won’t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.”

Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away.
—ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY

It is vain to do with more what can be done with less.

Pareto’s Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs.
80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time.
80% of company profits come from 20% of the products and customers.

It’s easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that lack of time is actually lack of priorities

We create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it. You have to. I don’t feel that anymore.
—OPRAH WINFREY

Simplicity requires ruthlessness.

If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do?

If someone isn’t making you stronger, they’re making you weaker.

Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?”

Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?

you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of “task creep”—doing more to feel productive while actually accomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary goals or tasks per day.

There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant.
—RALPH WALDO EMERSON

develop an uncanny ability to be selectively ignorant. Ignorance may be bliss, but it is also practical.

Learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace.
—ROBERT J. SAWYER

Focus on what digerati Kathy Sierra calls “just-in-time” information instead of “just-in-case” information.

Do your own thinking independently. Be the chess player, not the chess piece.

It’s amazing how someone’s IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them.

People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don’t realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world.
—CALVIN, from Calvin and Hobbes

Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units—and thus manage fewer customers—and fulfill our dreamlines. It’s faster.

• Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions, fewer returns, etc.). It’s less headache. This is HUGE.


• Higher pricing also creates higher profit margins. It’s safer.
