### A Sensational book. They really mean it when they say it's one of the best Self-help book out there.

#### Reading Notes:

One of the main weaknesses of mankind is the average man's familiarity with the word "impossible"
Success comes to those who become SUCCESS CONSCIOUS.

If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance.

There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning DESIRE to possess it. 

"SUCCESS REQUIRES NO APOLOGIES, FAILURE PERMITS NO ALIBIS".

There is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish.

> "Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds."

One may develop faith by voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith.

FAITH is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Infinite Intelligence can be harnessed and used by man.

Every man is what he is, because of the DOMINATING THOUGHTS which he permits to occupy his mind. Thoughts which a man deliberately places in his own mind, and encourages with sympathy, and with which he mixes any one or more of the emotions, constitute the motivating forces, which direct and control his every movement, act, and deed!

 The human mind is constantly attracting vibrations which harmonize with that which DOMINATES the human mind.

 We are what we are, because of the vibrations of thought which we pick up and register, through the stimuli of our daily environment.

“THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS TO THE MIND EXCEPT THOSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE.”

The world has the habit of making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where he is going.

Every human brain is capable of picking up vibrations of thought which are being released by other brains.

> You have ABSOLUTE CONTROL over but one thing, and that is your thoughts. This is the most significant and inspiring of all facts known to man!

This Divine prerogative is the sole means by which you may control your own destiny. If you fail to control your mind, you may be sure you will control nothing else.

The mind could produce ANYTHING THE MIND COULD CONCEIVE AND BELIEVE.

Mind control is the result of self-discipline and habit.

> The most practical of all methods for controlling the mind is the habit of keeping it busy with a definite purpose, backed by a definite plan.

Plato, “The first and best victory is to conquer self. To be conquered by self is, all things, the most shameful and vile”.
