#### Reading Notes:

### You are the Sun:

For them to see you shine, you must stay far away, for you are just like the sun; when you're too close, your light makes them blind.  And when you're too far, they seek you. So let them seek you. They're getting your light regardless, but appreciating your presence is different from recognizing your existence.

### An Ironic Reward for a Beautiful Heart:

Beautiful hearts are hard to find, and to reward them when we do find them, we convince ourselves that they're too good for us. What a reward. Instead of holding on to them, we pull ourselves away. We push them away. We forget that the beauty of their hearts comes from their ability to love and from their willingness to liberate those who hearts have caged themselves in the past.

Being a leader is about leading your own mind's logic and leading your heart's reason.

### Priorities:

Hold on to those you love very tightly. Love them back, respect them, cherish every moment you spend with them, and make them smile. Do not let a stressful day get in the way of spending the right time the right way on the right people.
