#### Reading Notes:

Thomas Merton once wrote, "Souls are like athletes who need opponents worthy of them if they are to be tried and extended and pushed to the full use of their powers."

Rumi, a 13th-century Persian mystic, told of a man who walked past a beggar and asked, "Why, God, do you not do something for these people?" God replied, "I did do something. I made you."

Mahatma Gandhi said, "To find yourself, lose yourself in the service of others."

The more you give of yourself, the more you find of yourself.

Og Mandino, "Success without happiness is the worst kind of failure."

"The sole purpose of education is to help you find out what you, with all your heart, most love to do!"

The write and teacher William Arthur Ward said, "A mediocre teacher tells, a good teacher explains, a superior teacher demonstrates, a great teacher inspires."

It is not what we tell our children that counts, it is what we do that they emulate.

Counselor Carol Ann Fried has a warning about expressing feelings. She says that it's not enough just to use the word "feel." When you follow the word "feel" with the word "that," it changes from a feeling into a thought.

Kahlil Gibran says, "To live in the heart of others is not to die."

Motivational author Robert Schuller asks, "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?"

How you see others is more a reflection of you than of them!

> In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, "It is one of the beautiful compensations of this life that no one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself."

Kahlil Gibran says, "Someone who has hurt you is also hurting, maybe with your kindness this hurt will go away."

The day you are able to feel joy in giving, no matter what your status, is the day you find bliss in life.

Socrates, "The unexamined life is not worth living."
