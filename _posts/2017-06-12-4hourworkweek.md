It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre.

Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.

The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?”

You won’t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.”

It’s easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that lack of time is actually lack of priorities

We create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it. You have to. I don’t feel that anymore.

Simplicity requires ruthlessness.

If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do?

If someone isn’t making you stronger, they’re making you weaker.

Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?”

Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?

you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of “task creep”—doing more to feel productive while actually accomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary goals or tasks per day.

There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant.

People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don’t realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world.
—CALVIN, from Calvin and Hobbes

Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units—and thus manage fewer customers—and fulfill our dreamlines. It’s faster.

• Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions, fewer returns, etc.). It’s less headache. This is HUGE.

• Higher pricing also creates higher profit margins. It’s safer.
