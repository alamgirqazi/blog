#### Reading Notes:

> Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.

Time teaches all things to he who lives forever but I have not the luxury of eternity.

> I will form good habits and become thir slaves.

> I will greet this day with love in my heart.

I will persist until I succeed.

I am rare, and there is value in all rarity; therefore, I am valuable. I am the end product of thousands of years of evolution.

> I am nature's greatest miracle.

> I will live this day as if it is my last.

If I feel inferior, I will wear new garments.

If I feel incompetent, I will remember past success.

If I feel insignificant, I will remember my goals.

I will master my moods through positive action and when I master my moods I will control my destiny.

> This too shall pass.

Never will I allow myself to become so important, so wise, so dignified, so powerful that I forget how to laugh at myself and my world. In this matter I will always remain as a child, for only as a child am I given the ability to look up to others; and so long as I look up to another I will never grow too long for my cot.

> I will laugh at the world.

> Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.

I will commit not the terrible crime of aiming too low.

> I will act now.
