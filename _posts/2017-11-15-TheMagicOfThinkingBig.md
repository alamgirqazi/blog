#### Reading Notes:

The "Okay-I'll-give-it-a-try-but-I-don't-think-it-will-work" attitude produces failures.

It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don't worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond.

Others see in us what we see in ourselves.

A person is a product of his thoughts. Believe Big and grow big.

Step One: Believe in yourself, believe you can succeed.

Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. 

Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never--yes, never--sell yourself short.

Isn't it surprising to you that most people understand so little about why people act as they do even though they are surrounded by people all their lives? Most people are not trained observes. One important purpose of this book is to help you train yourself to observe, to develop deep sight into human action.

It's fun to feel yourself growing more confident, more effective, more successful day by day, month by month. Nothing -- absolutely nothing -- in this life gives you more satisfaction than knowing you're on the road to success and achievement. And nothing stands as a bigger challenge than making the most of yourself.

Go deep into your study of people and you'll discover unsuccessful peple suffer a mind-deadening thought disease. We call this disease excusitis.

The right attitude and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.

> One may get a little sympathy, but one doesn't get respect and loyalty for being a chronic complainer.

Most of us make two basic errors with respect to intelligence:

1. We underestimate our own brainpower.
2. we overestimate the other fellow's brainpower.

The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you may have.

Just enough sense to stick with something - a chore
