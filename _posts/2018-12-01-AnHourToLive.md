#### Reading Notes:

“You will be remembered most, not from your accomplishments in life, but for how well you lived and how much love you carried in your heart.”

the best things in life aren’t things.

The key to a good life is this: If you’re not going to talk about something during the last hour of your life, then don’t make it a top priority during your lifetime.
