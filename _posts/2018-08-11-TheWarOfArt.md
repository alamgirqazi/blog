#### Reading Notes:

There‚Äôs a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don‚Äôt, and the secret is this: It‚Äôs not the writing part that‚Äôs hard. What‚Äôs hard is sitting down to write.

What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.

Do we have to stare death in the face to make us stand up and confront Resistance? Does Resistance have to cripple and disfigure our lives before we wake up to its existence?

it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.

Resistance arises from within. It is self-generated and self-perpetuated. Resistance is the enemy within.

Resistance obstructs movement only from a lower sphere to a higher. It kicks in when we seek to pursue a calling in the arts, launch an innovative enterprise, or evolve to a higher station morally, ethically, or spiritually.

So if you‚Äôre in Calcutta working with the Mother Teresa Foundation and you‚Äôre thinking of bolting to launch a career in telemarketing‚Ä¶ relax. Resistance will give you a free pass.

Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it‚Äôs the easiest to rationalize.

Doctors estimate that seventy to eighty percent of their business is non-health-related. People aren‚Äôt sick, they‚Äôre self-dramatizing. Sometimes the hardest part of a medical job is keeping a straight face.

What does Resistance feel like?

First, unhappiness. We feel like hell. A low-grade misery pervades everything. We‚Äôre bored, we‚Äôre restless. We can‚Äôt get no satisfaction. There‚Äôs guilt but we can‚Äôt put our finger on the source. We want to go back to bed; we want to get up and party. We feel unloved and unlovable. We‚Äôre disgusted. We hate our lives. We hate ourselves.

Unalleviated, Resistance mounts to a pitch that becomes unendurable. At this point vices kick in. Dope, adultery, web surfing.

Beyond that, Resistance becomes clinical. Depression, aggression, dysfunction. Then actual crime and physical self-destruction.

Sounds like life, I know. It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs Resistance.

What makes it tricky is that we live in a consumer culture that‚Äôs acutely aware of this unhappiness and has massed all its profit-seeking artillery to exploit it. By selling us a product, a drug, a distraction.

These are not easy questions. Who am I? Why am I here? They‚Äôre not easy because the human being isn‚Äôt wired to function as an individual. We‚Äôre wired tribally, to act as part of a group. Our psyches are programmed by millions of years of hunter-gatherer evolution. We know what the clan is; we know how to fit into the band and the tribe. What we don‚Äôt know is how to be alone. We don‚Äôt know how to be free individuals.

Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others. If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement. Watch yourself. Of all the manifestations of Resistance, most only harm ourselves. Criticism and cruelty harm others as well.

Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), ‚ÄúAm I really a writer? Am I really an artist?‚Äù chances are you are.

Are you paralyzed with fear? That‚Äôs a good sign.

Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do.

the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can be that that enterprise is important to us and to the growth of our soul. That‚Äôs why we feel so much Resistance. If it meant nothing to us, there‚Äôd be no Resistance.

The more Resistance you experience, the more important your unmanifested art/project/enterprise is to you‚Äîand the more gratification you will feel when you finally do it.

The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work.

is one thing to study war
and another to live the warrior‚Äôs life.

‚ÄîTelamon of Arcadia,
mercenary of the fifth century B.C.

Maugham reckoned another, deeper truth: that by performing the mundane physical act of sitting down and starting to work, he set in motion a mysterious but infallible sequence of events that would produce inspiration.

The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell, whether he knows it or not. He will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation.

The artist must be like that Marine. He has to know how to be miserable. He has to love being miserable. He has to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier or swabbie or jet jockey. Because this is war, baby. And war is hell.

The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist.

Tomorrow morning the critic will be gone, but the writer will still be there facing the blank page. Nothing matters but that he keep working.

Resistance wants us to cede sovereignty to others. It wants us to stake our self-worth, our identity, our reason-for-being, on the response of others to our work. Resistance knows we can‚Äôt take this. No one can.

These are serious fears. But they‚Äôre not the real fear. Not the Master Fear, the Mother of all Fears that‚Äôs so close to us that even when we verbalize it we don‚Äôt believe it.

Fear That We Will Succeed.

That we can access the powers we secretly know we possess.

That we can become the person we sense in our hearts we truly are.

This is the most terrifying prospect a human being can face, because it ejects him at one go (he imagines) from all the tribal inclusions his psyche is wired for and has been for fifty million years.
