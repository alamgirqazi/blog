Rating 9.5/10

Ryan Holiday is one of the best writers out there. I love his blogs and podcasts. He's the first person to introduce the stoic philosophy to me. This book from him is a masterpiece. Amazing insight on how to always stay humble and keep your ego in control. Ryan really is an inspiration for the new generation.
